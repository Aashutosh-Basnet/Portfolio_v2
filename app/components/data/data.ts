export const intro = `
I’m Aashutosh, a passionate developer who loves turning ideas into smooth, practical, and meaningful applications. I work across the full stack, building everything from clean and responsive interfaces to reliable backend systems that keep things running effortlessly. My go-to toolkit includes React, Next.js, Tailwind, Express, MongoDB, and a growing collection of AI and automation tools that I’m constantly experimenting with.

I have a huge curiosity for how things work behind the scenes—whether that’s setting up authentication, integrating APIs, training ML models, or optimizing database queries. Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into AI assistants, automation frameworks, and user-focused SaaS experiences, and I’m especially excited about building tools that genuinely help people work smarter, not harder.

Looking forward to what's ahead!

Best,
Aashutosh
